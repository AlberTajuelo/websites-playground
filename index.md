## Welcome to Websites Playground

I created this repository to enable testing with Selenium testing different kind of pages.

If you see that it is interesting but there is a page missing, create a PR with the changes... it will be highly appreciated!

### Websites

- [Website with three frames (deprecated)](webs/frames.html)
- [Website with button in new window](webs/new-window-js.html)
- [Website with anchor in new window](webs/new-window-blank.html)
- [Button with random id (btn-XXX)](webs/random-elements.html)
- [Button with random id (XXX-btn-YYY)](webs/random-elements-2.html)
